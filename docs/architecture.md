# Project Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Demo project.

## Overview

The project implements a complete DevOps pipeline for a Python Flask application, including:

- Application development with best practices
- Containerization with Docker
- Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions
- Continuous Deployment
- Comprehensive monitoring

## Application Architecture

The application follows a modern Flask architecture:

```
app/
├── main.py           # Main application code
├── requirements.txt  # Dependencies
└── tests/            # Test suite
    ├── conftest.py   # Test fixtures
    └── test_main.py  # Test cases
```

### Key Application Features

- **Application Factory Pattern**: The application uses Flask's application factory pattern to improve testability and provide better separation of concerns.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses python-dotenv to load configuration from environment variables.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Custom error handlers for 404 and 500 responses.
- **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive logging with proper formatting.
- **Health Check Endpoint**: Provides application health status for monitoring systems.
- **Metrics Exposure**: Prometheus metrics for monitoring application performance.

## Infrastructure Architecture

The infrastructure consists of the following components:

```
DevOps-CI-CD-Pipeline-Demo/
├── app/                 # Application code
├── .github/workflows/   # CI/CD pipeline definitions
├── monitoring/          # Monitoring configuration
│   ├── alertmanager/    # Alert configuration
│   ├── grafana/         # Dashboard configuration
│   └── prometheus.yml   # Metrics collection configuration
├── Dockerfile           # Container definition
├── docker-compose.yml   # Service orchestration
└── Makefile             # Development automation
```

### Infrastructure Components

#### Containerization

- **Dockerfile**: Defines a multi-stage build process with best practices:
  - Uses a minimal base image (Python slim)
  - Implements layer caching for dependencies
  - Runs as a non-root user for security
  - Uses gunicorn for production deployment

- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates the application and its dependencies:
  - Web service (Flask application)
  - Prometheus monitoring
  - Grafana dashboards
  - Alertmanager for notifications

#### Monitoring Stack

- **Prometheus**: Collects and stores metrics from the application
- **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics with dashboards
- **Alertmanager**: Manages and routes alerts based on predefined rules

## Network Architecture

The application uses Docker networking to connect the services:

- Web service exposes port 8080 to the host
- Prometheus exposes port 9090
- Grafana exposes port 3000
- Alertmanager exposes port 9093

Services communicate internally via the Docker network.

## Security Architecture

The application implements several security best practices:

- **Non-root User**: The application runs as a non-privileged user in the container
- **Container Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning with Bandit and Trivy
- **Dependency Auditing**: Checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Container Isolation**: Services run in isolated containers

## High Availability and Scalability

- **Health Checks**: Container health is monitored with regular checks
- **Automatic Restart**: Failed containers are automatically restarted
- **Resource Management**: Resource limits prevent overcommitment
- **Container Orchestration**: Ready for scaling with container orchestration

## Future Extensions

The architecture is designed to be extensible in the following ways:

1. **Database Integration**: Add persistent storage with containerized databases
2. **Load Balancing**: Scale horizontally with load balancing
3. **Service Mesh**: Implement service mesh for more complex microservices
4. **Secrets Management**: Integrate with secrets management solutions
5. **Distributed Tracing**: Add tracing for request flows across services
